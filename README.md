# patterns_codelab

A new Flutter project.

## Note
environment:
  sdk: ^3.0.0
Did you know? This is your first introduction to Dart 3! The caret ^ syntax can now be used for SDK constraints (although it has been supported for packages since Dart 1.8). Previously, this would be written >=3.0.0 <4.0.0
